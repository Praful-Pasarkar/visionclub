%pip install matplotlib
%pip install numpy

Click on the ARROW in black circle now. 
Please note the output should look like this:
	Requirement already satisfied: pandas ....
	Requirement already satisfied: python- ....
	...
	installing Sklearn ...

Click on "+ Code"
	import tensorflow as tf

	from tensorflow.keras import datasets, layers, models
	import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
Click on the ARROW in black circle now. 

Click on "+ Code"
	(train_images, train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = datasets.cifar10.load_data()

	# Normalize pixel values to be between 0 and 1
	train_images, test_images = train_images / 255.0, test_images / 255.0
Click on the ARROW in black circle now. 	


All above steps should be executed without any issues. 
Now Look at the Top left Google Colab icon. Next to it is Untitled*.pynb (* will be some number)
